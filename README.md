BeH2 ground state energy calculation using VQE for Qhack 2023

## QHack 2023 Quantum Chemistry Challenge

One of the main applications of quantum computing is the calculation of the ground state energy of specific molecules. As we calculate, we always work with approximations and models that simplify the real-world system, but move us away from the empirical results obtained in the laboratory. In this hackathon we will face a molecule a bit larger than normal: 
. Your goal will be, with the help of a quantum computational algorithm, to obtain a result as close as possible to the real ground state energy value. Not only will the obtained result be evaluated, but other parameters such as time efficiency and the cleverness of your ideas will also be taken into account.

To achieve accuracy with lowest resources, these methods were used:
1. Active Space selection
2. Grouping
3. Qubit reduction using symmetry and tapering
4. HF State tapering
5. Optimal sector selection
